Tiled Grace integrates tiled and textual editing of code

To see Tiled Grace in action, go to
<http://ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/minigrace/tiled>.

To use Tiled Grace yourself, copy in a minigrace.js file to the working
tree root. minigrace.js can be generated from a minigrace.git working
tree with:
    make es
and will then be in es/minigrace.js. You will also need to copy in the
corresponding version of background.js (which changes only
infrequently).

You will also need to obtain the ACE editor from <http://ace.c9.io/> and put
all of its .js files into the "ace" directory.

Any of the sample dialects you want to use should be compiled with the
same version of the compiler:
    minigrace --target es -o sniff.js sniff.grace
Some dialects may require modification to be used in Tiled Grace rather
than the ordinary web interface. The sample programs themselves are
loaded from .grace files and do not need precompilation.

Because of browser security rules, Tiled Grace must be served over HTTP
to work. Either copy it into your web root, or run an in-place web
server such as osws:
    osws -I index.html -m -M .woff application/font-woff \
        -M .json application/json -d .

Tiled Grace works best in recent versions of Chrome and Firefox. The
transition animation tends to lag for large or deeply-nested programs in
Firefox, but the system in other respects tends to work slightly better
there.
